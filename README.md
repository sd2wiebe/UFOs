# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The focus of this project was to create a dynamic webpage displaying data on UFO sightings, capable of taking user input for multiple fields to filter the data.

## Results
 
The refined webpage contains four additional filters to go along with the date filter. The additional fields include: City, State, Country and Shape.
